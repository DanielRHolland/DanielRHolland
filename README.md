### Hi!
I'm Dan, a Software Engineer from the UK living in Berlin. As well as all things tech, I also like learning languages, meeting new people, and going on adventures. 


I have an [online portfolio](https://www.danrh.co.uk/portfolio/), which exhibits a small fraction of the things that I have been up to. There [(or in this gist)](https://gist.github.com/DanielRHolland/b3ba8ef955635ca973ca594a122d2340) you can find my Final Year Uni Project (Producing Accurate Questions by both Generating and Assessing Questions using Neural Networks). Not yet on my portfolio is a writeup of my experiences working in a team to develop a Stores Management system, but the repos for this group project can be found here: [server/main](https://github.com/DanielRHolland/AADGroupProject) and [client](https://github.com/DanielRHolland/AADClient).

Among the things which I have been playing with recently is [QRep](https://github.com/DanielRHolland/qrep), which is a (very early days) project to make it easier to report maintainance issues using QR codes.
