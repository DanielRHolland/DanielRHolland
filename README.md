### Hi!
I'm Dan, a Software Engineer from the UK living in Berlin. As well as all things tech, I also like learning languages, meeting new people, and going on adventures. 

My current project is [QRep](https://github.com/DanielRHolland/qrep), a QR-driven issue reporting and field service management SaaS built (mainly) in golang. [Take a look!](https://github.com/DanielRHolland/qrep)

I have an [online portfolio](https://www.danrh.co.uk/portfolio/), which exhibits a small fraction of the things that I have been up to. [There](https://www.danrh.co.uk/uni/2020/06/30/fyp.html) [(or in this gist)](https://gist.github.com/DanielRHolland/b3ba8ef955635ca973ca594a122d2340) you can find my Final Year Uni Project Report (Producing Accurate Questions by both Generating and Assessing Questions using Neural Networks). I also have a writeup of my experiences with [Test-Driven Development in Haskell](https://www.danrh.co.uk/uni/2020/06/30/ase2.html). Not yet on my portfolio is a writeup of my experiences working in a team to develop a Stores Management system, but the repos for this group project can be found here: [server/main repo](https://github.com/DanielRHolland/AADGroupProject) and [client repo](https://github.com/DanielRHolland/AADClient). Another of my Uni Projects, which contains a Golang Web Service, a Scala/Scalatra Web Service, and an Angular client, [is viewable here](https://github.com/DanielRHolland/scc19). You may also be interested (depending on how excited you get by ERP systems) in reading about projects I have been involved with in industry: [Exel: Advanced Product Configurator](https://www.danrh.co.uk/industrial/2019/09/01/exelapc.html) and [Exel: Field Service Management](https://www.danrh.co.uk/industrial/2019/09/01/exelfsm.html).
