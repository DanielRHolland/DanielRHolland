### Hi!
I'm Dan, a Software Engineer from the UK living in Berlin. As well as all things tech, I also like learning languages, meeting new people, and going on adventures. 


I have an [online portfolio](https://www.danrh.co.uk/portfolio/), which exhibits a small fraction of the things that I have been up to. 

Among the things which I have been playing with recently is [QRep](https://github.com/DanielRHolland/qrep), which is a (very early days) project to make it easier to report maintainance issues and request restocking of products using QR codes to quickly report issues.

Contact me using [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danrholland) or email me@danrh.co.uk
